We'll use the concept of a \"redundant\" list of objects, where any one of the objects could potentially do the work we want, but some of the objects can't service the request at all at runtime so we need to try the next one, and the next, until we find one that works.\n",

We also define a couple of custom exceptions, one for when a server fails, and one to use later, if all servers fail."
